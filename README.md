#  OTT-Platform-Website-Apple-TV- Clone

## 📝 Project Description

This repository contains a front-end implementation of an Over-The-Top (OTT) media platform website, inspired by the sleek and modern user interface of **Apple TV+**.

The goal of this project was to practice front-end development skills by recreating a professional streaming service interface using standard web technologies.

## ✨ Features

* **Responsive Layout:** Designed to look good on various screen sizes.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Emulates the clean, dark-mode aesthetic and layout of the Apple TV interface.
* **Dynamic Content Sections:** Includes sections for featured content, trending movies, and categories.
* **Interactive Carousels/Sliders:** (If applicable, mention specific interactivity like hovering effects or horizontal scrolling for movie posters).
* **Pure Front-End:** Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (for structure)
* **CSS3** (for styling and layout)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** (for interactivity and DOM manipulation)
